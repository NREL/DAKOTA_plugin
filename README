Materials for openMDAO DAKOTA Driver object
-------------------------------------------

(Original author, Peter Graf, National Renewable Energy Lab, 2012. peter.graf@nrel.gov)

Overview
--------
This directory tree contains the materials for the initial version of an openMDAO "Driver" object that wraps
Sandia Lab's "DAKOTA" optimization and analysis code.  There are three different functionalities:

1. An interface to DAKOTA, in "library mode", that allows passing an MPI communicator and a "void *" object
to DAKOTA. This is still in C++.

2. A python wrapper for this interface, so, in python, you can say "import dakota", then "dakota.run_dakota(comm, object)".
"comm" will be used as the MPI communicator for DAKOTA, and "object" will be passed _back_ to the python routine
specified in your dakota input file.

3. An openMDAO Driver object that wraps all this functionality.  In particular, the "object" in 2. _is_ the driver, 
and a specific callback function is used that then calls this driver's "run_iteration" method.  Therefore, from the
user's point of view, DAKOTA is made to behave as if it were a normal openMDAO driver.

Further development by NASA/openMDAO
------------------------------------
The code in this directory is prototype code that was then handed off to the openMDAO team at NASA for further development.
Therefore, if you are interested in the above functionality, this code is _not_ the code you should use.
Instead, you should go to openmdao.org and find the "dakota driver" plugin.  This README file will be updated to refer
to the exact url when it is available.
